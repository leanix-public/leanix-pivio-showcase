# leanix-pivio-showcase

In order to set up the Pivio integration you need a few things to start.

You will need, as specified on Pivio's webpage (at: http://pivio.io/docs/), Java 8 and Docker installed.

It also would not be a bad idea to create the repositories, on your own github account, which are mentioned in the following shell script: https://github.com/ianhigginbottom/leanix-pivio-showcase/blob/master/1_checkout.sh. This can also be adapted if you would like to use different project; simply fork the repository and change the projects mentioned in the array. This is the array I am referring to in that shell script =====> projects="service-cart service-dataloader service-navigation service-product service-recommendation service-user frontend-catalog frontend-checkout frontend-registration"
